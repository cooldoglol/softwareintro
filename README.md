cool dog os is an OS made to make your computer faster and more reliable 
it is based of ubuntu 19.10 to make it more stable.
every update we update it based on a LTS based version of ubuntu to make it be supported longer
we based it of ubuntu 19.10 because 20.04 is only new and it is less stable.. i recomend waiting for a future update because a beta build is not stable and you will experience bugs and other problems

how to play windows games
download linux wine steam and play on linux  ETC
if you want to read more you can read it at the zorin os website since it is based of ubuntu
